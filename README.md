Chacka360 is an advanced solution designed to optimize agricultural production through UAVs (drones) and environmental sensor technologies. The platform empowers farmers to analyze vast tracts of land and make informed decisions based on real-time data and NASA satellite information.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Collects critical data such as temperature, humidity, altitude, atmospheric pressure, and air quality.
- **Satellite Data Integration**: Incorporates additional information like soil moisture and precipitation patterns provided by NASA.
- **Interactive Maps**: Identifies optimal zones for various crops based on soil conditions.
- **User-Friendly Platform**: Intuitive dashboard for visualizing data and recommendations.

## Project Components

### 1. Flutter Application
The mobile/dashboard application developed in Flutter allows farmers to visualize real-time data collected by the drone.
